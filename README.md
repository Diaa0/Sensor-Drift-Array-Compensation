This project contains deep learning models used in sensor drift compensation problem. We consider the dataset created by "Alexander Vergara and Shankar Vembu and Tuba Ayhan and Margaret A. Ryan and Margie L. Homer and RamÃ³n Huerta, Chemical gas sensor drift compensation using classifier ensembles, Sensors and Actuators B: Chemical (2012) doi: 10.1016/j.snb.2012.01.074."

You need numpy and tensorflow and matplotlib in order to run the codes.
The project cinatins 3 pieces of codes for different algorithms and the dataset itself. You can access the dataset itself from https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/gas+sensor+array+drift+dataset


The main model(s) are contained in sensor_drift_MLP_model.py
To run the models simply run the .py file and with the desired arguments.
